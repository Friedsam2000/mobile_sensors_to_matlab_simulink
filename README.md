# mobile_sensors_to_matlab_simulink
Analyze your Phones sensordata in Matlab / Simulink (Matlab Ambassador Event from 2022 at TUM)

With this Repo you can connect MATLAB on your PC with the MATLAB App on your IOS/Android Device to collect sensor data.
The sensor data from your phone (e.g. Accelerometer, Magnetometer) can be streamed live to MATLAB.

In this Repo you will find scripts that convert the sensor data for the phones orientation to plots in 3D. Check it out :)

This Repo has been ported from Gitlab at TUM
